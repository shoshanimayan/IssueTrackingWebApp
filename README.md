this is a proof of concept for an issue tracking web app, where a node js server delivers data on user created issues that have their importance voted on, and is then visualized on sorted in different ways on the react redux js front end.



1. **Install dependencies**

you'll need to install this app


npm install

1. **Run the backend**

The backend is a node server. Everything to do with the server lives in `/server`.



npm run backend


1. **Run the frontend**

Webpack is used to bundle and serve our app. Everything to do with the frontend lives in `/app`.



npm run frontend


Once everything is running, you should see the app running http://127.0.0.1:8080.
